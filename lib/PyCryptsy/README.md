PyCryptsy
=========

Python binding to the Cryptsy API (https://www.cryptsy.com/pages/api)

This is likely to be incomplete at first, with functionality added as I need it.  At first, I'm aiming to get enough implemented to enable CryptoSwitcher to auto-trade mined coins through Cryptsy.

example.py trades 10% of your Yacoin balance for Bitcoin at 1% over the current lowest buy price. Some of the functionality in this example could (probably should) be made into methods of the PyCryptsy class.
